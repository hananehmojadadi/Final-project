        <h2>Hananeh Mojadadi üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>
        <p>My name is Hananeh Mojadadi, and I am from Herat, Afghanistan.
             I am currently a computer science student with a strong interest in technology and creativity. 
             Alongside my studies, I am also a graphic designer and pursuing web design at Code to Inspire.
              In addition to my academic and design work, 
              I am gaining professional experience as a data entry employee.</p>
        <p>In your free time, you enjoy cooking cakes, playing volleyball,
             and watching English movies to improve your language skills ‚Äî although most of your time lately 
             goes into designing. You‚Äôve even worked as a data entry employee before, showing your willingness 
             to take on different kinds of work.</p>

        <p>I start my day with breakfast and a quick review of my online classes for computer science 
            and web design. Afterward, I work on my data entry job, followed by practicing graphic design.
             In the evening, I watch English movies to improve my language skills and sometimes bake or play
              volleyball. Before bed, I review my day and plan ahead.</p>
